  #NOTE: The above are assumed from the wrapper as we cannot have conflicting actions, so they're commented out here.

# WARNING! This playbook ASSUMES that the host it's targeting is built from the known base image
# Meaning it assumes the following:
# 1. All partitions listed are in order on disk from "Start of Disk" to "End of Disk"
# 2. Only 1 Disk mounted on /dev/sda
# 3. Main partition at /dev/sda1
# 4. Extended Partition at /dev/sda2
# 5. Swap Partition at /dev/sda5

# NOTE: The below is moved to wrapper playbook.
#  vars:
#    required_packages:
#      - cloud-guest-utils # This includes the growpart utility
#      - parted

    # NOTE: Moved to the wrapper playbook and the below will be executed as a list of tasks.

          This is meant to be run only once when the VM is created and bootstrapped.
